How long did this assignment take?
> It took me approximately 5 - 6 hours in total. I worked on the assignment in sprints of 2-hours or less. 

What was the hardest part?
> The most challenging part was to set up a database for the api. 

Did you learn anything new?
> It was my first time using PostgreSQL as the database and using jwt for verification, so I definitely learned something new!

Is there anything you would have liked to implement but didn't have the time to?
> I would have liked to implement delete user as well. Also, I would have liked to add test-suites to see if I missed any error-handling.

What are the security holes (if any) in your system? If there are any, how would you fix them?
> Right now the JWT header is the only way the user can be verified. I could see how easily the encrypted keys can get cracked and be used by someone else. My best guess would be to implement a secondary system that would validate the user again, although I'm not exactly sure how it can be implemented. Again, that could be something else for me to learn about! 

Do you feel that your skills were well tested?
> Yes. This was a fun assignment and honestly, I learned a lot :)
